My name is G.Anuvarshini.I from Tirupur.I completed my schooling in Sri Ramakrishna Vidyalaya Martic Higher Secondary School.
Now I am studying computer science and engineering in KGiSL.I choose this course because I wanted to learn more about coding.
But also I am little bit afraid because this college syllabus is totally different from school and also there is no specific books to study.
I am studying here in scholarship and this scholarship will be continued only if I get more than 70 or 80 percentage and this is what my fear. 
but I am confident about myself.
